# IAM System - Future Features Roadmap

This document outlines important features to consider for the evolution of the IAM system, moving beyond its current foundational capabilities towards a more robust and enterprise-grade solution.

## High-Priority Features (Security & Usability)

1.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
    *   **Description:** Implement support for various MFA methods (e.g., TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens) to significantly enhance user account security.
    *   **Why it's important:** Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

2.  **Account Lockout/Brute-Force Protection:**
    *   **Description:** Implement mechanisms to detect and mitigate brute-force attacks (e.g., locking accounts after multiple failed login attempts, rate limiting).
    *   **Why it's important:** Protects against automated password guessing attacks.

3.  **Password Policy Enforcement:**
    *   **Description:** Enforce strong password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, history checks, periodic expiration).
    *   **Why it's important:** Encourages users to create and maintain strong, unique passwords.

4.  **Audit Logging & Monitoring:**
    *   **Description:** Develop a dedicated, immutable audit trail for all security-relevant events (e.g., logins, logouts, password changes, role/permission modifications, user creation/deletion). Integrate with monitoring tools.
    *   **Why it's important:** Crucial for compliance, forensic analysis, and detecting suspicious activities.

5.  **User Self-Service (Password Reset):**
    *   **Description:** Implement secure self-service capabilities for users, starting with password reset functionality (e.g., via email verification).
    *   **Why it's important:** Improves user experience, reduces helpdesk load, and empowers users.

## Mid-Priority Features (Integration & Management)

6.  **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
    *   **Description:** Integrate with external Identity Providers (IdPs) using industry standards like OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0.
    *   **Why it's important:** Provides seamless access to multiple applications with a single set of credentials, enhancing user experience and simplifying access management.

7.  **User Groups:**
    *   **Description:** Introduce the concept of user groups to logically organize users. Roles and permissions can then be assigned to groups, simplifying management for larger user bases.
    *   **Why it's important:** Streamlines user and access management, especially in organizations with many users and varying access needs.

## Long-Term / Advanced Features

8.  **User Provisioning/Deprovisioning:**
    *   **Description:** Implement automated user lifecycle management (creation, update, deletion) with integrated applications using protocols like SCIM.
    *   **Why it's important:** Ensures consistency of user data across systems and automates onboarding/offboarding processes.

9.  **Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC) / Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**
    *   **Description:** Evolve beyond simple RBAC to allow more dynamic authorization decisions based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
    *   **Why it's important:** Enables highly flexible and context-aware access policies, suitable for complex enterprise environments.

10. **Session Management Enhancements:**
    *   **Description:** Implement more advanced session management features, such as concurrent session control, configurable session lifetimes, and forced session termination.
    *   **Why it's important:** Enhances security by providing greater control over active user sessions.

11. **Identity Federation:**
    *   **Description:** Establish trust relationships with external identity providers to allow users from other organizations to access your system.
    *   **Why it's important:** Facilitates B2B integrations and partner access.

12. **API Key Management:**
    *   **Description:** Develop a system for generating, revoking, and managing API keys for programmatic access, allowing specific permissions to be associated with each key.
    *   **Why it's important:** Provides a secure and auditable way for applications and services to interact with your system.

13. **Emergency Access/Break-Glass Accounts:**
    *   **Description:** Define and implement secure procedures for granting temporary, highly privileged access in emergency situations, with strict auditing.
    *   **Why it's important:** Ensures business continuity during critical incidents while maintaining security.
